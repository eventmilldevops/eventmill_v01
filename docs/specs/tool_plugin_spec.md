# Event Mill Tool Plugin Specification

Version: 0.3.0
Aligned with: eventmill_v1_1.md (v0.2.0-draft)

Changes from 0.2.0:
- Added `QueryHints` dataclass for intent-based LLM routing
- Added `query_with_document()` and `supports_native_document()` to `LLMQueryInterface`
- Added `hints` parameter to `query_text()`
- Added `storage_uri` field to `ArtifactRef`
- Added `model_used`, `transport_path`, `fallback_reason` diagnostic fields to `LLMResponse`
- See companion spec: `llm-dispatcher-native-document-handling.md`

---

## Purpose

This document defines the minimum contract for Event Mill plugins. It is the **normative** specification for plugin development. Where this document and other design documents conflict, this document wins for plugin behavior.

The goals are:

- consistent tool behavior across all five investigation pillars
- deterministic plugin discovery and routing
- reduced LLM context consumption through compressed summaries
- CI-validatable plugin packages before acceptance
- support for local, verified, experimental, and deprecated plugins without framework code changes

This specification borrows proven extension patterns from Metasploit modules, Terraform providers, and editor extension ecosystems. A plugin is self-describing, schema-driven, and executable through a stable runtime contract.

---

## Normative Language

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are interpreted per RFC 2119.

---

## Plugin Packaging Requirements

Every plugin MUST live in its own directory and MUST include:

```text
<plugin_name>/
├── manifest.json
├── tool.py
├── README.md
├── schemas/
│   ├── input.schema.json
│   └── output.schema.json
├── examples/
│   ├── request.example.json
│   └── response.example.json
├── tests/
│   └── test_contract.py
└── data/                          # OPTIONAL — plugin-specific reference data
    └── <reference_files>
```

A plugin MAY include additional implementation files, helper modules, fixtures, or static assets.

The optional `data/` directory contains plugin-specific reference data that extends or overrides the framework's common reference data when this plugin is active. If present, the plugin manifest MUST document any overrides in the `reference_data_overrides` field, and the README MUST explain what is overridden and why.

---

## Directory Placement

Plugins are grouped by pillar:

```text
plugins/
├── network_forensics/
│   ├── pcap_metadata_summary/
│   ├── pcap_ip_search/
│   ├── pcap_flow_analyzer/
│   └── firewall_log_aggregator/
├── cloud_investigation/
├── log_analysis/
│   ├── event_source_profiler/
│   ├── pattern_extractor/
│   ├── threat_intel_ingester/
│   ├── context_enriched_analyzer/
│   └── image_analyzer/
├── risk_assessment/
└── threat_modeling/
    ├── threat_model_builder/
    ├── attack_path_generator/
    └── attack_path_renderer/
```

The pillar folder is an organizational and routing boundary. A plugin MUST declare the same pillar in `manifest.json` as the directory it is stored under.

---

## Plugin Identity and Naming

Each plugin MUST have a stable `tool_name`.

Rules:

- lowercase letters, digits, and underscores only
- SHOULD begin with a short domain prefix when useful: `pcap_`, `azure_`, `gcp_`, `risk_`, `ti_`, `tm_`
- MUST be unique across the loaded registry
- SHOULD remain stable across backward-compatible releases

---

## Manifest Requirements

Each plugin MUST provide a valid `manifest.json` conforming to `manifest_schema.json`.

Key changes from 0.1.0:

- `artifacts_supported` is replaced by `artifacts_consumed` and `artifacts_produced` to support tool chaining
- `requires_llm` is a new field for tools that depend on LLM capabilities
- `reference_data_overrides` declares which framework reference data entries the plugin extends
- `chains_to` is an advisory field for the router describing downstream tool compatibility

See `manifest_schema.json` for the complete field reference.

---

## Capability Declaration

Capabilities drive routing and tool filtering.

A plugin MUST declare capabilities using concise namespace-style strings.

Recommended namespaces:

| Namespace | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `artifact` | Input/output types | `artifact:pcap`, `artifact:pdf_report` |
| `operation` | What the tool does | `operation:search`, `operation:parse`, `operation:enrich`, `operation:summarize` |
| `entity` | Objects the tool reasons about | `entity:ip`, `entity:dns`, `entity:ioc`, `entity:mitre_technique` |
| `domain` | Subject area | `domain:network_forensics`, `domain:threat_intel` |
| `output` | Output format | `output:table`, `output:mermaid`, `output:json` |

Rules:

- capabilities MUST be strings matching `^[a-z]+:[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$`
- capabilities SHOULD be stable and reusable across plugins
- capabilities SHOULD be broad enough to enable routing but specific enough to differentiate tools
- capabilities MUST NOT encode implementation details

---

## Artifact Support

Plugins declare artifact relationships with two fields:

- `artifacts_consumed` — input types the tool accepts
- `artifacts_produced` — output types the tool generates

Supported artifact types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pcap` | Network packet capture files |
| `json_events` | Structured event records in JSON |
| `log_stream` | Semi-structured or unstructured log data |
| `risk_model` | Risk assessment or threat model output |
| `cloud_audit_log` | Cloud provider audit trail exports |
| `pdf_report` | PDF-formatted threat intel reports, vendor advisories |
| `html_report` | HTML-formatted blog posts, advisories, CERT bulletins |
| `image` | JPG/PNG images for physical intrusion or visual analysis |
| `text` | Plain text, CSVs, generic structured text |
| `none` | Tools requiring no input artifact (e.g., interactive threat model builder) |

Use `none` in `artifacts_consumed` only for tools that generate output from user interaction alone.

Use `none` in `artifacts_produced` only for tools whose output is purely informational text displayed inline (no registered artifact).

---

## Stability Classes

Each plugin MUST declare a `stability` level:

| Level | Meaning | Default visibility |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `experimental` | Local testing, not enabled by default | Hidden unless opted in |
| `verified` | Contract tests pass, code reviewed | Visible, not auto-invokable |
| `core` | Maintained by the project team | Visible, follows `safe_for_auto_invoke` |
| `deprecated` | Loadable but scheduled for removal | Hidden unless opted in |

---

## Runtime Interface

The runtime contract is Python-based. The tool module MUST expose a class whose name matches `class_name` in the manifest. That class MUST implement `EventMillToolProtocol`:

```python
from typing import Protocol, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class ToolResult:
    """Standard tool execution result."""
    ok: bool
    result: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    error_code: str | None = None
    message: str | None = None
    details: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    output_artifacts: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None


@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    """Input validation result."""
    ok: bool
    errors: list[str] | None = None


class EventMillToolProtocol(Protocol):

    def metadata(self) -> dict:
        """Return runtime metadata. Reflects manifest plus derived runtime values.
        Used for diagnostics, registry inspection, and debugging."""
        ...

    def validate_inputs(self, payload: dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate the request payload against the input schema.
        MUST NOT perform any analysis work or side effects."""
        ...

    def execute(self, payload: dict, context: 'ExecutionContext') -> ToolResult:
        """Perform the tool's analysis work and return a structured result.
        
        Rules:
        - MUST NOT mutate framework state directly
        - MUST NOT call other plugins directly
        - MUST treat context as read-only
        - SHOULD prefer deterministic logic
        - MUST raise predictable exceptions or return structured errors
        - MUST register output artifacts via context.register_artifact()
        """
        ...

    def summarize_for_llm(self, result: ToolResult) -> str:
        """Return a compressed, human-readable summary for the LLM context window.
        
        Rules:
        - MUST be brief (target: under 500 tokens)
        - SHOULD include only the most important findings
        - MUST NOT repeat the full structured output
        - MUST NOT invent facts not present in result
        - MUST NOT include binary data references
        
        This method is a critical differentiator for Event Mill.
        Most MCP-based projects skip explicit output compression,
        leading to context window bloat and degraded LLM reasoning.
        """
        ...
```

---

## Execution Context Contract

The framework supplies an `ExecutionContext` object to `execute()`. This replaces the raw `context: dict` from v0.1.0.

```python
@dataclass
class ExecutionContext:
    """Read-only execution context supplied by the framework."""
    
    # Session identity
    session_id: str
    selected_pillar: str
    
    # Artifact access
    artifacts: list[ArtifactRef]        # Registered artifacts in this session
    
    # Framework services (read-only interfaces)
    config: dict                         # Framework and plugin configuration
    logger: logging.Logger               # Namespaced logger: eventmill.plugin.<tool_name>
    reference_data: ReferenceDataView    # Common + plugin-specific reference data
    
    # Capabilities
    llm_enabled: bool                    # True if MCP connection is live
    llm_query: LLMQueryInterface | None  # None if llm_enabled is False
    
    # Artifact registration (the one write operation plugins may perform)
    register_artifact: Callable[[str, str, str, dict], ArtifactRef]
    
    # Execution limits
    limits: dict                         # timeout, max_output_size, etc.


@dataclass
class ArtifactRef:
    """Reference to a registered artifact. Immutable after creation."""
    artifact_id: str
    artifact_type: str                   # From the artifact type enum
    file_path: str                       # Resolved path on the storage backend
    storage_uri: str | None = None       # Cloud storage URI (e.g. gs://bucket/path.pdf)
    source_tool: str | None = None       # None for user-provided artifacts
    metadata: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
```

The `storage_uri` field is populated when an artifact resides in cloud storage. Plugins MAY use this for display or logging but MUST NOT resolve it directly — the framework handles cloud transport via the LLM dispatcher.

Plugins MUST treat missing optional attributes gracefully. Plugins MUST NOT assume any undocumented attributes exist.

---

## LLM Query Interface

Plugins that require LLM capabilities (manifest `requires_llm: true`) use the `LLMQueryInterface` from the execution context.

### QueryHints

Plugins pass optional `QueryHints` to guide model selection without knowing provider details:

```python
@dataclass
class QueryHints:
    """Plugin hints to the LLMDispatcher about what kind of query this is."""
    tier: str = "light"                    # "light" | "heavy"
    needs_reasoning: bool = False          # biases toward deep-reasoning models
    needs_structured_output: bool = False  # ensures JSON-mode capable model
    prefers_native_file: bool = False      # prefer native file > text extraction
    max_budget_cents: float | None = None  # cost ceiling per call (safety net)
```

All fields have sensible defaults. Plugins that do not pass hints get the same behavior as before (token-count-based routing).

### LLMQueryInterface

```python
class LLMQueryInterface(Protocol):

    def query_text(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        system_context: str | None = None,
        max_tokens: int = 4096,
        grounding_data: list[str] | None = None,
        hints: QueryHints | None = None,
    ) -> LLMResponse:
        """Send a text prompt to the connected LLM.
        
        grounding_data: Additional context strings injected before the prompt.
        hints: Optional routing hints for model selection.
        """
        ...

    def query_multimodal(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        image_data: bytes,
        image_format: str,
        system_context: str | None = None,
        max_tokens: int = 4096,
    ) -> LLMResponse:
        """Send a multimodal (text + image) prompt to the connected LLM.
        
        If the connected model does not support vision, MUST return
        an LLMResponse with ok=False and error indicating capability gap.
        """
        ...

    def query_with_document(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        artifact: ArtifactRef,
        system_context: str | None = None,
        max_tokens: int = 8192,
        grounding_data: list[str] | None = None,
        hints: QueryHints | None = None,
    ) -> LLMResponse:
        """Query with a document artifact.
        
        The dispatcher resolves the best ingestion path automatically:
          1. Native document + remote URI (gs:// for Gemini) — zero-copy
          2. Native document + inline bytes from local file
          3. Fallback: returns ok=False so plugin can use text extraction
        
        The response's transport_path field records which path was used.
        Plugins SHOULD prefer this method over manual text extraction for
        PDF artifacts.
        """
        ...

    def supports_native_document(self, mime_type: str) -> bool:
        """Check if any connected model handles this MIME type natively.
        
        Returns True if at least one connected model supports native
        ingestion of the given MIME type (e.g. "application/pdf").
        Plugins MAY use this to choose between native ingestion and
        text-extraction fallback paths.
        """
        ...
```

### LLMResponse

```python
@dataclass
class LLMResponse:
    ok: bool
    text: str | None = None
    error: str | None = None
    token_usage: dict | None = None
    model_used: str | None = None          # which model actually ran the query
    transport_path: str | None = None      # "gs_uri", "inline_bytes", "text_fallback", or "text"
    fallback_reason: str | None = None     # why the preferred path wasn't used
```

The diagnostic fields (`model_used`, `transport_path`, `fallback_reason`) are informational. Plugins MAY log them for debugging but MUST NOT branch on specific model names.

The framework owns the MCP client. Plugins MUST NOT create their own MCP connections. All LLM interaction goes through the context interface, which allows the framework to:

- enforce rate limiting and cost tracking
- inject system context and reference data grounding
- log LLM interactions at DEBUG level per the logging spec
- handle timeouts and retries at the transport level
- route queries to appropriate model tiers based on hints
- resolve native document ingestion paths transparently

---

## Input and Output Schemas

A plugin MUST provide both `schemas/input.schema.json` and `schemas/output.schema.json`.

Rules:

- MUST use JSON Schema draft 2020-12 with `$schema` set
- MUST include descriptions for all required fields
- SHOULD model errors separately from success results
- SHOULD avoid unbounded free-form objects unless justified
- Output schema MUST support the `ToolResult` envelope: `{ok, result, error_code, message, details, output_artifacts}`

---

## Error Handling

Plugins SHOULD return structured failure data via the `ToolResult` envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error_code": "INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "ip_address is required",
  "details": {}
}
```

Recommended error codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILED` | Payload does not conform to input schema |
| `ARTIFACT_NOT_FOUND` | Referenced artifact does not exist |
| `ARTIFACT_UNREADABLE` | Artifact file exists but cannot be parsed |
| `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` | requires_llm=true but MCP connection is down |
| `LLM_CAPABILITY_GAP` | Connected model lacks required capability (e.g., vision) |
| `LLM_QUERY_FAILED` | LLM returned an error or unparseable response |
| `TIMEOUT` | Execution exceeded the timeout_class limit |
| `DEPENDENCY_MISSING` | Required Python package not available |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected failure — include details for debugging |

---

## Timeouts and Cost Hints

Each plugin MUST declare `timeout_class`:

| Class | Default limit | Use case |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `fast` | 30 seconds | Interactive, single-file parsing |
| `medium` | 120 seconds | Multi-step analysis, moderate I/O |
| `slow` | 600 seconds | LLM-intensive, large artifact processing |

A plugin MAY declare `cost_hint` (`low`, `moderate`, `high`) for future scheduling and UI display.

---

## Auto-Invocation Safety

Each plugin MUST declare `safe_for_auto_invoke`:

- `true` — read-only, low-risk, low-cost tools the LLM may invoke without analyst confirmation
- `false` — tools with external side effects, high cost, or results that require analyst judgment before acting on

---

## Tests

Each plugin MUST include at least one contract test (`tests/test_contract.py`) that verifies:

1. manifest.json loads and validates against manifest_schema.json
2. input schema and output schema load and are valid JSON Schema
3. entry_point module imports without errors
4. tool class can be instantiated
5. `validate_inputs()` correctly accepts the example request
6. `validate_inputs()` correctly rejects a deliberately malformed request
7. example request validates against input schema
8. example response validates against output schema
9. `summarize_for_llm()` returns a non-empty string under 2000 characters when given the example response
10. `metadata()` returns a dict containing at minimum `tool_name` and `version`

---

## README Requirements

Each plugin README MUST include:

- Purpose and use cases
- Supported artifact types (consumed and produced)
- LLM dependency status (requires_llm)
- Example request and response
- Example `summarize_for_llm()` output
- Limitations and known gaps
- Safety notes (auto-invoke considerations)
- Dependency notes (packages beyond framework baseline)
- Reference data overrides (if any)

---

## Versioning

Plugin `version` MUST use semantic versioning:

- Patch: non-breaking fixes
- Minor: backward-compatible enhancements (new optional output fields)
- Major: breaking contract changes (input schema changes, output schema restructuring)

---

## Backward Compatibility

A plugin SHOULD preserve its input/output contract within a major version. On breaking changes:

- increment major version
- update schemas, examples, tests, and README
- add a migration note to the README

---
